# Indexing (new) MED data

Note on permissions: Updating the data requires:
  * An account on the dev machine (nectar) that is a member of the group 'dromedary-staging' on the dev machine (to 
put `In_progress_MEC_files.zip` up there) 
  * Permission to deploy dromedary via `moku`
  
Contact A&E if you need either.

## Kubernetes

You must be behind the LIT firewall to build the data image.
`$ docker build -t ghcr.io/mlibrary/dromedary/dromedary_data:latest -f data.Dockerfile .`
If the package is private (currently the case) then the pod will need an [ImagePullSecret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)


## Synopsis

* Download content of [the box folder](https://umich.box.com/s/ah2imm5webu32to343p2n6xur828zi5w),
which creates `In_progress_MEC_files.zip`. Copy that file to the dev server (currently
nectar) in the directory `/hydra-dev/dromedary-data/build`

From any machine behind the LIT firewall, run (cut/paste) the following commands for
the instance you're targeting.

* Prepare the data for indexing (always done on staging, doesn't actually affect anything right away):
  * `ssh deployhost exec dromedary-staging "bin/dromedary newdata prepare /hydra-dev/dromedary-data/build/In_progress_MEC_files.zip"`
* Actually index the data, which takes the relevant site out of commission for a while (30mn?)
  * Testing: `ssh deployhost exec dromedary-testing "bin/dromedary newdata index"`
  * Staging: `ssh deployhost exec dromedary-staging "bin/dromedary newdata index"`
  * Production:  `ssh deployhost exec dromedary-production "bin/dromedary newdata index"`
  
Anyone deploying must have been given permission to do so from A&E.

## Overview

Deployment of both code and data is done from a unix-like command line. This can
be in a terminal window on you Macintosh or from any server we use in the
library (e.g., malt).

To deploy new data, there are just a few steps:

* [Deploy new _code_](docs/deploying.md) if need be (almost certainly not)
* Get the new data as a .zip file and upload it to the development machine
* _Prepare_ the new data for indexing
* _Index_ the new data

## 1. Get the new data as a zip file and put it on the dev server

[2019-12-16 the dev server is "nectar"]

When new data is ready, Paul will announce that it's ready to go
and in Box.

* Got to [the box folder](https://umich.box.com/s/ah2imm5webu32to343p2n6xur828zi5w) 
where we keep everything and click on the "Download" button. This will put a 
file called "In_progress_MEC_files.zip" wherever things download for you.
* Copy that file to the development box. Right now the dev server is `nectar`,
but if things change just substitute the new machine.

You now have the new files on your desktop/laptop. We need to get them
to the dev server. 

_If you have a program you use to upload/download from servers_ go ahead
and use it. If not, the shell command on a Mac would be:

```bash
scp ~/Downloads/In_progress_MEC_files.zip nectar:/hydra-dev/dromedary-data/build
```

If this doesn't make sense or you get errors (maybe you're not allowed to
deploy dromedary?) ask A&E for help.

## Prepare the new data for later indexing (do this *once*)

We need to turn the raw data into something the program can use. This 
doesn't change anything running, it just makes new files on disk
that can be used later to actually update a running instance.

_This only needs to be done once_. All three instances 
(testing/staging/production) use the same prepared data for indexing,
and we always run the prepare on staging because otherwise there
are permissions errors.

(You can just copy and paste this)

```bash
ssh deployhost exec dromedary-staging "bin/dromedary newdata prepare /hydra-dev/dromedary-data/build/In_progress_MEC_files.zip"
```

_This will take quite a while_! Like, upwards of an hour.

Sadly, there's no way to get any feedback from the deployhost commands, so
unless you see an error you just have to assume it's all
going well.

## Index the new data into a specific instance

Now the data can be indexed into one of our three instanced: testing, staging,
or production.

_Each instance has it's own solr and must have its index created separately_!

NOTE: While indexing is occurring, the instance in question will display a message stating that 
"The MED is temporarily unavailable". Once indexing is finished, everything 
will be back to normal.

  * Testing: `ssh deployhost exec dromedary-testing "bin/dromedary newdata index"`
  * Staging: `ssh deployhost exec dromedary-staging "bin/dromedary newdata index"`
  * Production:  `ssh deployhost exec dromedary-production "bin/dromedary newdata index"`

This doesn't take nearly as long as the prepare -- more like 30mn or so.
